EDDI was created by the legendary [jgm, aka CMDR McDonald](https://github.com/cmdrmcdonald), who also created the initial versions of [Coriolis](https://coriolis.io/) and [EDRefCard](https://edrefcard.info/).

Around September 2017, jgm stepped back from all Elite-related development and handed over to a team consisting of:

  * [CMDR Hoodathunk](https://github.com/Hoodathunk)
  * [CMDR T'kael](https://github.com/Tkael)
  * [VerticalBlank (CMDR Ky Vatta)](https://github.com/richardbuckle)

Sadly, CMDR Hoodathunk passed away on 2nd September 2020 after suffering a severe stroke. His contribution was massive, his advice was always wise, and he is sorely missed.
